# BIDS - Brain Imaging Data Structure 

**What is bids?** See https://bids.neuroimaging.io

How to convert your data into BIDS?
Several converters exist: dcm2bids, heudiconv, bidscoin, bidskit, etc...

Here is a tutorial from Andy's Brain Book using **dcm2bids** --> https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OpenScience/OS/BIDS_Overview.html

A tutorial is also offered on the **dcm2bids github page** --> https://unfmontreal.github.io/Dcm2Bids/docs/tutorial/first-steps/ 

A useful tool to anonymize BIDS dataset is [BIDSonym](https://peerherholz.github.io/BIDSonym/)



###In the word file you can find a short explanation using dcm2bids with an example of a configuration file and an event.tsv file###

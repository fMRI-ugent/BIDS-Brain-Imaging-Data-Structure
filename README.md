# BIDS - Brain Imaging Data Structure 

**What is bids?** See https://bids.neuroimaging.io

Here you find the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1112GFfZgLcbMD3hrEZmxbJ0KnnUbRtT2Q3vWXuRktnA/edit?usp=sharing) and the [recording](https://ugentbe-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/vincent_hoofs_ugent_be/EdmA_YqCoBVHusd-uUY5pqEBHrymGtDwoQob-ke9bL8JVg?e=YbjVN5) of a talk on bids from Remi Gau at UGent (CCN meeting) on January 2023.

How to convert your data into BIDS?
Several converters exist: dcm2bids, heudiconv, bidscoin, bidskit, etc...

Here is a tutorial from Andy's Brain Book using **dcm2bids** --> https://andysbrainbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/OpenScience/OS/BIDS_Overview.html

A tutorial is also offered on the **dcm2bids github page** --> https://unfmontreal.github.io/Dcm2Bids/docs/tutorial/first-steps/ 

A useful tool to anonymize BIDS dataset is [BIDSonym](https://peerherholz.github.io/BIDSonym/).

In this repository you can find further information and material on how to use
